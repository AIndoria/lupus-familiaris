Find a Friend, Save a Life; Now Near You


**TODO**

Here's a list of things I am aiming to do in this project, and I will keep adding/crossing-out things as I keep building this. Please note that this is not a "What this project does" list, but rather, a "Develop this" list.

* Proper project structure along with Express.
 * Proper CSS file Structure
 * Local Assets
* Pet-recognition
 * Compare with photos of pets in shelters which provide the pictures in a database/API
* List adoptable pets(Start with dogs)
